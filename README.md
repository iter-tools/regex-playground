# @iter-tools/regex-playground

`regex-playground` provides a playground for `@iter-tools/regex` to help you see how the engine evaluates patterns. It is useful for learning how a regex engine works, and for debugging.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is using the [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/) component library and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Getting Started

To develop on this project run the `dev` [script](https://gist.github.com/conartist6/4f784765b76977ab3b95dc2b26ee9a15), which runs a local web server which live-reloads changes.
